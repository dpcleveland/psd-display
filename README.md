# Display
Display is a PSD-to-website project built with the Bootstrap framework. It is based off of the <a href="http://www.bestpsdfreebies.com/freebie/display-psd-theme/" target="_blank">Display PSD theme from bestpsdfreebies.com</a>. I took liberties in the responsive design features as they were not included in the theme.
